9: Practicing With The Else Statement

Append any names in planet_names that are longer than 5 characters to long_names. 
Otherwise, append the names to short_names. To accomplish this:
Loop through each item in planet_names.
Use the len() function to find the length of the item.
If the length is greater than 5, append the item to long_names.
Otherwise, append it to short_names.
When complete, short_names should contain any planet names less than 6 characters long, 
and long_names should contain any planet names 6 characters or longer.

Result:

planet_names = ["Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Neptune", "Uranus"]
short_names = []
long_names = []
for name in planet_names:
    if len(name) > 5:
        long_names.append (name)
    else:
        short_names.append (name)
        
10: Counting With Dictionaries

Count up how many times each element occurs in the dictionary named pantry that appears in the code block below. 
You'll need to:
Create an empty dictionary named pantry_counts.
Loop through each item in pantry.
If the item appears in pantry_counts, add 1 to the value in pantry_counts for the item's key.
Otherwise, add the item to pantry_counts as a key, with the value 1.
When finished, each item in pantry will have its own key in pantry_counts, 
and its value will be the number of times the item appears in pantry.

Result:
pantry = ["apple", "orange", "grape", "apple", "orange", "apple", "tomato", "potato", "grape"]
pantry_counts = {}

for  item in pantry:
    if item in pantry_counts:
        pantry_counts[item] = pantry_counts[item] + 1
    else:
