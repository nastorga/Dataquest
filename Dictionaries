9: Practicing With The Else Statement

Append any names in planet_names that are longer than 5 characters to long_names. 
Otherwise, append the names to short_names. To accomplish this:
Loop through each item in planet_names.
Use the len() function to find the length of the item.
If the length is greater than 5, append the item to long_names.
Otherwise, append it to short_names.
When complete, short_names should contain any planet names less than 6 characters long, 
and long_names should contain any planet names 6 characters or longer.

Result:

planet_names = ["Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Neptune", "Uranus"]
short_names = []
long_names = []
for name in planet_names:
    if len(name) > 5:
        long_names.append (name)
    else:
        short_names.append (name)
